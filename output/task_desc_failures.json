This is because the divisors of \\( n \\) can be paired as \\( (1, n), (2, n/2), (3, n/3), \\ldots \\), and each pair multiplies to \\( n \\).\n\nGiven that the product of all positive divisors of \\( n \\) is \\( 24^{240} \\), we can write:\n\\[ n^{d/2} = 24^{240} \\]\nwhere \\( d \\) is the number of divisors of \\( n \\). This implies:\n\\[ n^{d/2} = (2^3 \\cdot 3)^{240} = 2^{720} \\cdot 3^{240} \\]\nThus, we have:\n\\[ n^{d/2} = 2^{720} \\cdot 3^{240} \\]\nThis means \\( n \\) must be of the form \\( 2^a \\cdot 3^b \\) for some non-negative integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). Let \\( n = 2^a \\cdot 3^b \\). The number of divisors \\( d \\) of \\( n \\) is given by:\n\\[ d = (a+1)(b+1) \\]\nSo we have:\n\\[ (2^a \\cdot 3^b)^{(a+1)(b+1)/2} = 2^{720} \\cdot 3^{240} \\]\nThis implies:\n\\[ 2^{a(a+1)(b+1)/2} \\cdot 3^{b(a+1)(b+1)/2} = 2^{720} \\cdot 3^{240} \\]\nBy comparing the exponents of 2 and 3, we get:\n\\[ \\frac{a(a+1)(b+1)}{2} = 720 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{b(a+1)(b+1)}{2} = 240 \\]\nFrom the second equation, we can solve for \\( b \\):\n\\[ b(a+1)(b+1) = 480 \\]\nWe need to find integer solutions to these equations.

If \\( b = 6 \\):\n\\[ 6(a+1)(7) = 480 \\]\n\\[ 42(a+1) = 480 \\]\n\\[ a+1 = \\frac{480}{42} = \\frac{80}{7} \\]\nThis is not an integer, so \\( b = 6 \\) is not a solution.\n\n5. If \\( b = 5 \\):\n\\[ 5(a+1)(6) = 480 \\]\n\\[ 30(a+1) = 480 \\]\n\\[ a+1 = \\frac{480}{30} = 16 \\]\n\\[ a = 15 \\]\nSo, \\( n = 2^{15} \\cdot 3^5 = 2^{15} \\cdot 3^5 \\).\n\nWe need to check if these solutions satisfy the first equation:\nFor \\( n = 2 \\cdot 3^{15} \\):\n\\[ d = (1+1)(15+1) = 2 \\cdot 16 = 32 \\]\n\\[ (2 \\cdot 3^{15})^{32/2} = (2 \\cdot 3^{15})^{16} = 2^{16} \\cdot 3^{240} \\]\nThis is not equal to \\( 2^{720} \\cdot 3^{240} \\), so \\( n = 2 \\cdot 3^{15} \\) is not a solution.\n\nFor \\( n = 2^{15} \\cdot 3^5 \\):\n\\[ d = (15+1)(5+1) = 16 \\cdot 6 = 96 \\]\n\\[ (2^{15} \\cdot 3^5)^{96/2} = (2^{15} \\cdot 3^5)^{48} = 2^{720} \\cdot 3^{240} \\]\nThis is equal to \\( 2^{720} \\cdot 3^{240} \\), so \\( n = 2^{15} \\cdot 3^5 \\) is a solution.\n\nThus, the only solution is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2^{15} \\cdot 3^5} \\]"

We can factor out the common terms in the numerator and the denominator:\n\\[\n\\frac{2^a - 2^b}{2^c - 2^d} = \\frac{2^b (2^{a-b} - 1)}{2^d (2^{c-d} - 1)} = \\frac{2^{b-d} (2^{a-b} - 1)}{2^{c-d} - 1}\n\\]\nThis shows that the expression is a ratio of two terms, each of which is a power of 2 minus 1.
