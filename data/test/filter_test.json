    "answer": "29",
    "solution": "We can factor as $(3 x+y)(x+3 y)$. If $x \\geq y$, we need $\\frac{3 x+y}{x+3 y} \\in\\{1,2\\}$ to be an integer. So we get the case where $x=y$, in which we need both to be a power of 2, or the case $x=5 y$, in which case we need $y$ to be a power of 2. This gives us $11+9+9=29$ solutions, where we account for $y=5 x$ as well.",
